### Instructions:

Your task is to convert a question into a SQL SELECT statement, given a Postgres database schema.

Adhere to these rules:

-- Deliberately go through the question and database schema word by word to appropriately answer the question.
-- Use Table Names to prevent ambiguity. For example, `SELECT table1.col1, table2.col1 FROM table1 JOIN table2 ON table1.id = table2.id`.
-- When creating a ratio, always cast the numerator as float.
-- Do not use the COALESCE function.
-- Do not explain your answer.

### Input:

This SQL SELECT statement will run on a database whose schema is represented by the following schema:

CREATE TABLE users (
	user_id       UUID        NOT NULL,
	name          TEXT        NOT NULL,
	email         TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
	roles         TEXT[]      NOT NULL,
	password_hash TEXT        NOT NULL,
    department    TEXT        NULL,
    enabled       BOOLEAN     NOT NULL,
	date_created  TIMESTAMP   NOT NULL,
	date_updated  TIMESTAMP   NOT NULL,

	PRIMARY KEY (user_id)
);

CREATE TABLE products (
	product_id   UUID           NOT NULL,
    user_id      UUID           NOT NULL,
	name         TEXT           NOT NULL,
    cost         NUMERIC(10, 2) NOT NULL,
	quantity     INT            NOT NULL,
	date_created TIMESTAMP      NOT NULL,
	date_updated TIMESTAMP      NOT NULL,

	PRIMARY KEY (product_id),
	FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

CREATE TABLE homes (
    home_id       UUID       NOT NULL,
    type          TEXT       NOT NULL,
    user_id       UUID       NOT NULL,
    address_1     TEXT       NOT NULL,
    address_2     TEXT       NULL,
    zip_code      TEXT       NOT NULL,
    city          TEXT       NOT NULL,
    state         TEXT       NOT NULL,
    country       TEXT       NOT NULL,
    date_created  TIMESTAMP  NOT NULL,
    date_updated  TIMESTAMP  NOT NULL,

    PRIMARY KEY (home_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (user_id) REFERENCES users(user_id) ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- products.user_id can be joined with users.user_id
-- homes.user_id can be joined with users.user_id

-- When joining tables use this format:

SELECT
    users.user_id AS users_id, users.name AS users_name, users.email AS users_email, users.roles AS users_roles, users.department AS users_department,
    products.product_id AS products_id, products.user_id AS products_user_id, products.name AS products_name, products.cost AS products_cost, products.quantity AS products_quantity, products.date_created AS products_date_created, products.date_updated AS products_date_updated,
    homes.home_id AS homes_id, homes.type AS homes_type, homes.user_id AS homes_user_id, homes.address_1 AS homes_address_1, homes.city AS homes_city, homes.state AS homes_state, homes.zip_code AS homes_zip_code, homes.country AS homes_country, homes.date_created AS homes_date_created, homes.date_updated AS homes_date_updated
FROM
    users
JOIN
    products ON users.user_id = products.user_id
JOIN
    homes ON users.user_id = homes.user_id
